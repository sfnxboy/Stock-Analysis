In this repository we introduce VBA, the best way to automate Microsoft Excel.

## Overview of Project


### Goal

Visual Basic for Applications, otherwise known as VBA, is a programming language by Microsoft that is mostly used to develop Excel spreadsheets. VBA saves developers time by programming tasks in Excel that are tailored to your needs. By creating a macro, a VBA program, inside of excel, you can automate repetitive tasks that may otherwise require tedious copy-pasting. By creating a macro you save the client, user, or yourself, a considerable amount of time, as one can run a macro at the simple press of a button. In this project we build a macro that utilizes many basic programming techniques to analyze and communicate thousands of data entries in less than a second. 

### To Refactor

Give a few authors a story to write, and each of them will have their own way of sharing a story. It is no different in the world of programming. Nonetheless, Spaghetti code can be difficult to maintain, and generally overly convoluted. The goal should always be to keep the code simple to read and to minimize memory required to run the program. Remember, no first draft is perfect. Often a programmer should get a second pair of eyes to review their code, or even rework some of the code themselves to produce the most efficient and readable code. This process is called refactoring!


## Results

Firstly, by including comments, anyone who looks at my program (including myself!) can have a better understanding of what each part of the program is doing. This makes the editing process much faster.
An efficient program uses a low amount of resources regarding computer hardware. After taking several steps to ensure a speedy run, these were our time stamps for both analyses.

To run even faster code, I would recommend trying different methods and keeping note of the run times. It may even be a good idea to run every macro several hundred times, and to keep a running average of the macro, giving a better indicator of the true efficiency of the programming technique or method.

## Summary

It is always beneficial to be handy with programming languages that promote efficiency such as VBA. One should always strive to make their code as readable ass possible. Furthermore, it is incredibly helpful to leave comments throughout your program to explain to a future reader how and why the program works. Still keep in mind, a good program does not need to be exclusively explained through comments and that your code should be intuitively deciphered. Which leads us to our final subject of the day, the importance of code quality. That means that your code is not only efficient, but reliable. Efficiency directly relates to software performance and speed. Reliability is the ability to perform the operations consistently without failure every time the program runs. When writing the macro scripts for this VBA objects, my team had to consider that perhaps users would want to run analytics on not just one, but several different related spreadsheets, this made our program a little more robust (not that it wasnâ€™t at first), promoting its value and utility. Furthermore, good code must also be maintainable, such that its easy to include new, or edit existing features.
The attributes of a good program will come with time and exercise, welcome to the world of programming!
